# The Linux Advisor
A Windows Application written in C#, with GUI. It's intended usage is for an easy GNU/Linux transition for new users. It can be a hazard to find just the right distribution for some, and this aims to give them a list of recommendations. A way for the head ache to be a bit less brain haemorrhage for those wanting to step away from Windows/Apple.
